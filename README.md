# JavaScript Highlight

### Requirements
1. Initial state will display as detailed above, without the grid background. Each line on the grid
background represents 10px to be used for element sizing.

2. At wider screen widths, the left and right side elements will be horizontally spaced evenly with respect
to each other and the edges of the screen and be center-aligned vertically.

3. At narrow screen widths, the left and right side elements will stack vertically and be center-aligned
horizontally.

4. If the user enters an integer between 1 and 9 and clicks the “HIGHLIGHT” button, only the
corresponding number will be highlighted in the 3x3 grid.

5. If the user enters something other than an integer between 1 and 9 and clicks the “HIGHLIGHT” button,
an error message displays in red below the “Select Number” input field: “Please enter a number
between 1 and 9”.

6. If the user clicks the “CLEAR” button, the “Select Number” input field will be cleared and no numbers
will be highlighted in the 3x3 grid.
